    <h1>To My Dearest Attaye Zehra</h1>
    <p>
      From the very first moment we began talking, even though miles separated us, my heart started gravitating toward you in ways I never imagined possible. I fell in love with your soul, your kindness, your words, and the light you radiate — all from a distance. Every text, every call, every late-night conversation made me feel like I was exactly where I was meant to be — right there with you, even if only in spirit. Your laughter became my favorite sound, your thoughts became my peace, and your dreams became mine too. I started loving you because you made me feel seen, valued, and understood in ways no one ever had. Despite the distance, or maybe even because of it, I saw the purity and strength of our connection. It's not just love — it's something more. It's an unbreakable bond, a promise written in the stars. From day one, I knew you were someone incredibly special, and that feeling only grows stronger with each passing day. No matter where life takes us, I want you to know this: you are my heart, my joy, and the love that will carry me to the very end. I will love you always, through every distance and beyond every horizon. Forever and endlessly, it's you, Attaye Zehra.
